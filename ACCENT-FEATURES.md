# 🎨 New Accent Features Guide

## What's New?

I've added **powerful accent control features** that let you experiment with different ways to create groove and dynamics in your techno patterns!

---

## 📥 Download Options

### **1. Clean MIDI (Original)**
- All drum hits at **equal velocity (80)**
- Perfect if you want to add your own dynamics in your DAW
- No accents in the MIDI file

### **2. MIDI with Separate Accent Track (NEW!)**
- **Main track**: All drums at equal velocity
- **Accent track**: Click/side stick sounds on ONLY the accented beats
- This is SUPER useful for:
  - Layering your own custom accent sounds
  - Seeing exactly where accents fall
  - Creating unique accent effects in your DAW
  - Automating effects on the accent track

**Example workflow:**
1. Download "with Accent Track"
2. Import both tracks into your DAW
3. Main track = your drums (clean)
4. Accent track = route to different samples, filters, distortion, etc.

## 🎛️ Custom Rhythm Editor (NEW PAGE!)

### **What It Does:**
A fully interactive drum sequencer where YOU create the patterns!

### **How to Use:**

1. **Click any cell** to toggle a hit:
   - First click = **Green** (normal hit)
   - Second click = **Yellow/Gold** (accented hit)
   - Third click = **Off**

2. **Choose Accent Type** to hear the difference:
   - 🔊 **Velocity** (standard - louder)
   - 🎚️ **Layer** (adds highpass filtered "crack")
   - 🎵 **Pitch** (shifts pitch up 5% - great for claps/hats!)

3. **Quick Start Presets:**
   - Four-on-the-Floor (classic techno)
   - Minimal (sparse)
   - Breakbeat (syncopated)
   - Clear All

4. **Play & Experiment** - try different accent types!

5. **Download** your custom pattern as MIDI

## 🎚️ Accent Types Explained

### **💡 Velocity Accents (Standard)**
**What it does:** Accented hits are played **louder**

**When to use:**
- Classic TR-909 style
- Most common in techno
- Simple and effective
- Works on all drums

**Technical:** Accent = velocity 110, Normal = velocity 80

---

### **🎚️ Layer Accents (Textural)**
**What it does:** Adds a **highpass-filtered click** on accented beats

**When to use:**
- Modern hard techno / industrial
- Add "crack" or "snap" to kicks
- Create presence and cut through the mix
- Want accents to have different tonal character

**How it works:**
- Base sound plays at normal volume
- Additional highpass-filtered noise burst plays simultaneously
- Creates harmonics and brightness

**Pro tip:** In your DAW, use the accent track to trigger a transient shaper or add distortion only on accents!

---

### **🎵 Pitch Accents (Groovy)**
**What it does:** Shifts pitch **up 5%** on accented beats

**When to use:**
- Claps (sounds AMAZING!)
- Hi-hats (creates rolling feel)
- Percussion
- Less common on kicks (but try it!)

**Why it works:**
- Creates movement and evolution
- Natural groove feel
- Adds musicality to percussive elements

**Pro tip:** Subtle pitch changes create groove without being obvious. Your brain perceives it as "more interesting" even if you can't consciously hear the pitch shift!

## 🔧 Using in Your DAW

### **Workflow Ideas:**

#### **1. Custom Accent Layers**
```
Download: MIDI with Accent Track
DAW Setup:
- Track 1: Main drums → your 909 samples
- Track 2: Accent track → route to:
  * Different kick sample (punchy)
  * Clap with reverb
  * Transient shaper
  * Saturation/distortion
```

#### **2. Automation on Accents**
```
Download: MIDI with Accent Track
- Use accent track to trigger automation
- Modulate filter cutoff
- Automate sends to effects
- Control sidechain compression
```

#### **3. Polyrhythmic Accents**
```
Custom Editor:
- Create main pattern
- Add accents in 3/4 pattern over 4/4 beat
- Creates hypnotic, off-grid groove
- Download and use!
```

## 💡 Creative Ideas

### **For Kicks:**
- **Velocity**: Classic power
- **Layer**: Add punch and attack
- **Pitch**: Experimental (try it!)

### **For Snares/Claps:**
- **Velocity**: Standard dynamics
- **Layer**: Add "snap"
- **Pitch**: Creates rolling clap patterns ✨

### **For Hi-Hats:**
- **Velocity**: Basic dynamics
- **Layer**: Add sizzle
- **Pitch**: Beautiful rolling grooves ✨✨✨

### **For Percussion:**
- **Velocity**: Simple dynamics
- **Layer**: Add texture
- **Pitch**: Create evolving shaker patterns

## 🎓 Theory: Why Accents Matter

### **Groove = Dynamics**
- Without accents: robotic, flat, lifeless
- With accents: human feel, movement, energy

### **The TR-909 Accent Button**
- Hardware 909 had ONE accent button
- Could only accent ONE instrument at a time
- This limitation created classic grooves!

### **Modern Production**
- You can accent EVERY drum differently
- Layer different accent types
- Create complex polyrhythms
- But remember: **less is more**

---

## 🎹 Quick Examples

### **Example 1: Classic Techno Groove**
```
Kick: 1, 3 accented (beats 1 & 3)
Snare: 2, 4 normal
Hats: All normal with 2 accents per bar on open hat
Accent type: Velocity
```

### **Example 2: Minimal Groove**
```
Kick: Only beat 1 accented
Hats: Sparse, 3-step polyrhythm with pitch accents
Accent type: Pitch (for hats), Velocity (for kick)
```

### **Example 3: Hard Techno**
```
Kick: All beats accented with layer
Clap: 2, 4 with pitch shift up
Hats: Rolling pattern with pitch accents
Accent type: Layer (kick), Pitch (clap/hats)
```

2. **Accent the downbeats** (beats 1 & 3) for driving techno
3. **Try polyrhythmic accents** - 3-step pattern over 4 beats = hypnotic
4. **Layer different accent types** - velocity on kicks, pitch on hats
5. **In your DAW, experiment** - the accent track is a playground!
